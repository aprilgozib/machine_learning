    "scikit-learn provides little support for implementing deep learning models (<a href=\"https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.neural_network\">here</a>). The most popular deep-learning framework is keras. \n",

    "\n",
    "There are several frameworks for deep learning that help build neural networks - TensorFlow, Theano, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK) etc. Keras acts as a wrapper for these framework in python using the frameworks in the backend for fast computation while providing a user friendly and easy-to-learn front-end. \n",
    "\n",
    "Keras is fully integrated with TensorFlow 2.0, which is the primary backend engine of keras.\n",

    "3. Create output layer to handle targets\n",
    "4. Build virtually any model you like in between\n",
